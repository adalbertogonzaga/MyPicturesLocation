# MyPicturesLocation
MyPicturesLocation is a Java based system used to insert/embed "Geolocation"/GPS coordinates on image files by storing it on EXIF data.

The entire project was developed using the Eclipse IDE and Java language.
* Eclipse Oxygen.3a
* Java 1.8

To handle the EXIF data it was used the Apache Commons Imaging library (Apache Sanselan):
 *  https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-imaging/ 
 * 	https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-imaging/download_sanselan.cgi

To draw the systems's GUI it was used the Eclipse's WindowBuilder (v1.9.1) plugin
 * http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/windowbuilder?mpc=true&mpc_state=

This system was developed for my personal needs/purposes, since I like to have stored in my pictures the location where I took them. As my main camera doesn't have a GPS I decided to develop a quick and simple program to insert the GPS coordinates on my pictures.

The program was initially developed on August, 2016 and it was very "unusable", with a lot of features which were making it hard to use and to maintain, so I decided to get only the basic stuff, wrap it on a simple package and make it available. There are a lot of improvement opportunities, but for now it's enough for my needs. I got used to it...

The last working version is already compiled and ready to download -> Look for the MyPicturesLocation.jar file

Cheers!
